You are a senior Next.js developer. Improve and complete a professional, scalable appointment booking system in Next.js. Use your own advanced logic to redesign, optimize, and enhance the system. Ensure the system is modular, maintainable, and production-ready. Build with the latest Next.js 15+ (App Router, Server Actions if needed). Follow best coding practices (TypeScript preferred, but JavaScript if necessary). Focus on performance (code splitting, lazy loading, caching). Follow clean UI/UX standards. (Use Tailwind CSS or another UI framework.)
