## ðŸ¦· Dental Implants: Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Pre-Operative Instructions (Before Surgery)**

#### A. Consultation & Planning
- Attend all pre-surgical appointments.
- Provide your complete medical history, including medications, allergies, and conditions like diabetes or heart disease.
- Inform your dentist if you are pregnant or taking blood thinners.
- Undergo imaging scans (like CBCT) and dental impressions as needed.

#### B. Before the Day of Surgery
- Follow any dietary restrictions (usually no food or drink 6â€“8 hours before surgery if under general anesthesia).
- Take prescribed medications as directed (e.g., antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs).
- Arrange for someone to drive you home after surgery.

#### C. On the Day of Surgery
- Wear comfortable clothing.
- Avoid wearing makeup, jewelry, or contact lenses.
- Brush your teeth gently before coming in.

### 2. **Post-Operative Instructions (After Surgery)**

> ðŸ’¡ Follow these carefully to reduce complications and promote healing.

#### A. First 24 Hours
- **Bite on gauze pad**: Keep pressure on the surgical site for 30â€“60 minutes to control bleeding.
- **Avoid spitting, rinsing, or using straws**: This helps prevent dislodging the blood clot.
- **Apply ice packs**: Use intermittently (15 min on/off) to reduce swelling.
- **Take medications as prescribed**: Painkillers, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories should be taken exactly as instructed.

#### B. Diet
- Stick to **soft foods** (e.g., soup, mashed potatoes, yogurt) for the first few days.
- Stay hydrated with cool or warm liquids.
- Avoid hot, spicy, crunchy, or chewy foods until cleared by your dentist.

#### C. Oral Hygiene
- **Do not brush near the surgical site** for the first 24 hours.
- After 24 hours, gently rinse with **warm salt water** (1/2 tsp salt in 8 oz warm water) several times a day.
- Begin brushing carefully around the area after 24 hours, avoiding direct contact with the surgical site.
- Use an antimicrobial mouthwash if prescribed.

#### D. Activity
- Rest and keep your head elevated.
- Avoid strenuous exercise for at least 48â€“72 hours.
- Do not smoke â€” smoking can significantly impair healing and increase implant failure risk.

#### E. Watch for Complications
Contact your dentist immediately if you experience:
- Excessive bleeding that doesnâ€™t stop
- Severe pain not relieved by medication
- Swelling that worsens after 2â€“3 days
- Fever or signs of infection
- Numbness that doesnâ€™t go away

### 3. **Healing Period (Osseointegration Phase)**

- Healing typically takes **3â€“6 months**, depending on your jawbone density and implant location.
- Avoid placing pressure or chewing on the implant site during this time (if itâ€™s a temporary restoration).
- Attend all follow-up appointments to monitor healing and integration.

### 4. **Long-Term Care of Dental Implants**

Once your permanent crown, bridge, or denture is placed:

#### A. Oral Hygiene
- Brush twice daily with a soft-bristled toothbrush.
- Floss daily, especially around the implant(s).
- Use interdental brushes or water flossers as recommended.
- Continue using antimicrobial mouthwash if advised.

#### B. Regular Dental Visits
- Visit your dentist every 6 months or as recommended.
- Professional cleanings are essential for maintaining implant health.

#### C. Lifestyle Habits
- Avoid smoking â€” it increases the risk of peri-implantitis (infection around the implant).
- Avoid chewing hard objects like ice or pens.
- If you grind your teeth, ask about a night guard to protect implants and restorations.
